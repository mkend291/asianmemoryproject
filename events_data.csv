Supported by the Butler School of Music Rainwater and Faculty Innovation Grant, this production included music commissions, poetry, and art inspired by Hayao Miyazaki films and Joe Hisaishi film scores. 

In Summer 2022, AMP collaborated with the Austin Public Library (APL) to produce concerts and educational resources for the Miyazaki Fest. The series concluded with sold out events at the APL Central Library and an unforgettable experience for team members and attendees alike.
